# Linkforge

A URL shortener with real-time click analytics, built incrementally as the course project for **Golang для розробників**.

The design is specified in the project TDD; this repository is the skeleton it describes.

## Current state

**Skeleton only.** Every seam in the architecture exists as an interface with a Null Object implementation that satisfies it and does nothing. Nothing is wired together and no behaviour is implemented yet — each milestone replaces one set of `Noop*` types with real ones.

Each file declares exactly one interface alongside its no-op implementation, so the compile-time contract and its placeholder stay together. Types shared by several interfaces live in the package's `model.go`.

## Layout

```
pkg/                        reusable libraries — a separate Go module
  shortid/  Codec           base62 encode/decode                       M1
            Generator       collision-resistant code issuing           M4
  cache/    Cache[K,V]      bounded cache on the redirect hot path     M4

internal/                   application code
  link/     Store           link persistence, declared by its consumer M1 / M7
            Shortener       the domain service behind every transport  M2
  click/    Ingester        non-blocking submission from the hot path  M5
            Store           append-only raw event persistence          M7
            Aggregator      time series and top-N queries              M5
            Publisher       fan-out to live WebSocket subscribers      M9
  auth/     Issuer          access token minting                       M9
            Verifier        token validation for middleware            M9
            UserStore       account persistence                        M7
  transport/Server          uniform listener lifecycle                 M6 / M8
  config/   Loader          environment-only configuration             M3
  observability/Metrics     counters and histograms                    M10
```

The `pkg/` tree is a second module so that reusable libraries stay free of any dependency on application code; `go.work` ties the two together for local development.

## Design rules

These hold for every milestone.

1. **Interfaces are declared by the consumer.** `link.Store` lives in `internal/link` because the shortener is what needs it — not beside any implementation. Constructors return concrete types.
2. **The dependency arrow points inwards.** `internal/link` and `internal/click` may not import a transport or a storage package.
3. **Analytics never blocks a redirect.** `Ingester.Submit` drops events under saturation rather than applying backpressure.
4. **Every listener shares one lifecycle contract**, which is what makes a single coordinated graceful shutdown possible.

## Working on it

```bash
make            # vet, lint and test — the same gates CI runs
make build
make test
make cover
make bench
make tidy
```

Requires Go 1.25+. Linting uses [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run) (`brew install golangci-lint`).
